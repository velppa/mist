# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Start of Session

Read project documents to load context:

- `docs/design-system.md` — visual design, typography, colours, layout
- `docs/technical-architecture.md` — platform, framework stack, directory structure, critical rules

Also check `plans/` for any active plan.

## Project Overview

MIST is a collaborative markdown editor — a cross between GitHub Gist and Google Docs. Users can quickly share and do multiplayer editing on markdown documents in real-time. Everything is public by URL (no auth yet). Documents persist live with no save button.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects (SQLite storage)
- **Frontend:** React Router 7 (SSR) + Cloudflare Agents SDK
- **Editor:** TipTap 3 + Yjs (CRDT multiplayer)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Testing:** Vitest with v8 coverage

## Prerequisites

Requires Node.js 22+ (see `.nvmrc`). Before running commands:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
```

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Local development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run deploy       # Build and deploy to Cloudflare Workers
npm run typecheck    # Full TypeScript type checking (runs cf-typegen + react-router typegen + tsc)
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run test         # Vitest with coverage
npm run test:watch   # Vitest in watch mode
npm run cf-typegen   # Generate Cloudflare Worker types

# Run a single test file
npx vitest run tests/unit/lib/critic-parser.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
npx vitest run -t "pattern"
```

## Architecture

See `docs/technical-architecture.md` for full details.

### Directory Layout

- `agents/` — Server-side Durable Object agents (currently just `DocumentAgent`)
- `app/components/` — React UI components
- `app/lib/` — Editor logic, CriticMarkup, Yjs provider, utilities
- `app/shared/` — Constants and types shared between client and server
- `app/routes/` — File-based routing (`home.tsx`, `docs.$id.tsx`, `new.ts`)
- `workers/app.ts` — Cloudflare Worker entry point
- `tests/` — Unit tests (`tests/unit/`) and integration tests (`tests/integration/`)

### Import Path Alias

`~` resolves to `app/` (configured in tsconfig and vitest). Use `~/lib/foo` instead of relative paths.

### Critical Rule: Server/Client Separation

Client-side React components must **never** import from `agents/`. The `agents` package uses `cloudflare:` protocol imports that don't exist in the browser. Use `app/shared/` for types needed by both sides.

### Real-Time Collaboration Flow

The multiplayer system works as follows:

1. **`DocumentAgent`** (`agents/document.ts`) — a Durable Object that holds a Yjs `Y.Doc` in memory, persists state to SQLite on every update, and relays Yjs sync/awareness messages between connected WebSocket clients.
2. **`yjs-provider.ts`** (`app/lib/`) — client-side WebSocket provider that connects to the agent at `/agents/document-agent/:docId` and handles Yjs sync protocol encoding/decoding.
3. **TipTap** uses `@tiptap/extension-collaboration` (bound to the Yjs doc's `XmlFragment`) and `@tiptap/extension-collaboration-caret` for cursor awareness.
4. **Worker entry** (`workers/app.ts`) — `routeAgentRequest()` intercepts `/agents/:agent/:name` requests before React Router handles the rest.

### CriticMarkup / Suggest Mode

Track-changes functionality spans multiple files:

- `app/lib/critic-marks.ts` — ProseMirror mark definitions (criticAddition, criticDeletion, criticComment, criticHighlight) with `inclusive: false`
- `app/lib/suggest-mode.ts` — ProseMirror plugin that intercepts edits and applies addition/deletion marks instead of direct changes
- `app/lib/critic-parser.ts` — Parses CriticMarkup syntax (`{++ ++}`, `{-- --}`, etc.) into clean text + mark ranges
- `app/lib/critic-serializer.ts` — Serializes marks back to CriticMarkup delimiter syntax
- `app/lib/critic-markup.ts` — TipTap extension that wires up the CriticMarkup marks and delimiter decorations

### Testing Constraints

- The `agents` package uses `cloudflare:` imports — it **cannot** be imported in plain Vitest. Test agent logic through integration tests or mock the imports. Unit tests should focus on pure logic in `app/lib/` and `app/shared/`.
- Coverage thresholds ramp linearly from 0% to 80% between Feb–Dec 2026 (see `vitest.config.ts`).
- Tests live in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`, mirroring the source structure.

### ESLint Conventions

- Unused variables must be prefixed with `_` (e.g., `_args`, `_ctx`).
- Tagged template expressions are allowed (for `this.sql` in Durable Objects).
